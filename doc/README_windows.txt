Intro
-----
Cryptogenic Bullion is  a free open source project derived from Novacoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient scrypt-based crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of Bitcoin and PPCoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake
help further advance the field of crypto-currency.

Moreover, modifications to the Cryptogenic Bullion protocol will support all new
facets of internet applications.  Please see http://MADEsparq.org for an example

Intro
-----
Bitcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.
